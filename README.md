User Authentication System
This is a small web application (backend) built using Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT for authentication. It allows users to:

Register with their details (username, email, password, full name, gender, date of birth, and country).
Login to get a JWT token for authentication.
Search for users by username or email.
The application enforces server-side validation and follows a structured source code architecture. It also demonstrates the API functionality using Postman.

Features
User Registration: Store user information securely in MongoDB.
User Login: Authenticate users using JWT tokens.
User Search: Retrieve user details by username or email.
Data Validation: Enforce validation on the server side.
